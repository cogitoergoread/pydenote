One if not *the* main principle of a Zettelkasten is the principle of connection.

There are typically three entities mentioned:

1. Data
2. Information
3. Knowledge

There are in a hierarchy with data being the simplest and knowledge the most sophisticated. One of the big questions out there is: How can you get from data to information to knowledge?

Every attempt to answer this questions has one thing in common: Connection.

1. What to connect Data, Information, Knowledge?
2. How to connect Data, Information, Knowledge?

While we don't have a theoretical answer to this theoretical question we can give the practical solution to knowledge work with quite robust confidence: Make connection possibel.

There are different types of connection:

1. Direct links............ [ Direct Links as Wiki-Links](denote:20211027T054300)
2. tags (ref. tagcloud).... [ Tags in The Archive](denote:20211029T062300)
